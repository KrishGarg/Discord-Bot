# Discord-Bot
# Docs: https://docs.mydiscordbot.ga/
### I haven't been making any progress as I got school and I am waiting for discord.py 2.0 to come out. It is gonna have buttons, menus and a lot of other new features.
## Important Note: Some may ask why is this public. This will be explained later in the faqs. This will be a fully functional, all-purpose discord bot. <br><br>
## My plans have changed and now this is going to be a dynamic-multi-server-compatible bot. Don't worry, this will still be a open source bot.<br><br>
## If you still wish to host the bot on your own by rebranding it, you are more than welcome to do it for free but on one condition that in either the `ping` command or the `help` command, you link this repository. You can do it like: <br><br> In Embeds -> [Source Code](https://github.com/KrishGarg/Discord-Bot) <br>In Normal Messages -â†“ <br>Link to bot's source code: <br>https://github.com/KrishGarg/Discord-Bot<br><br>*Link to the repository might change in future<br>I hope that you follow the above if you rebrand my code. :) <br><br>
## Some faqs:
## \> Why are you giving the source code for free? <br>Ans: I don't really know. I just like to help, and I was learning how to code a bot so here is some help.<br><br>I couldn't really think of any more FAQ's so feel free to ask me questions.<br><br>
## This bot is still is beta and there are many commands left. I hope I get enough time to complete this bot and everyone uses it. Even if you are creating your own bot and are here for just a part of code or just a command, please just leave a review or star the repository as that just gives me more confidence that the code I wrote is useful.<br><br>
## Because of the change of plans, this project will take even longer but I assure you that I will try my best to make this bot capable enough that you won't need any other bot in your server and my bot will be able to help you in everything!<br><br>
# Thank You!
