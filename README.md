# Discord-Bot
## Important Note: Some may ask why is this public. This will be explained later in the faqs. This will be a fully functional, all-purpose discord bot. 
## This bot will be server specific so if you want a bot specific to your server, and you have a bit of coding experience, you can edit the code accordingly.
## There are a few ways to host the bot. A free way would be hosting it on repl using uptime bot or if you are willing to spend a bit for a trusted and official hosting, just get a cheap vps and host the bot on it.
## Some faqs:
## \> Why are you giving the source code for free? <br>Ans: I don't really know. I just like to help and I was learning how to code a bot to here is some help.
## \> Why would we waste time in setting up your bot if we can get one like carl bot? <br>And. Yes you surely can. I prefer server based bots as they indicate professionalism in your server and also it is easier to fix bugs and it is more reliable rather than just waiting for a popular bot to come back online.

## This bot is still is beta and there are many commands left. I hope I get enough time to coplete this bot and everyone use it. Even if you are creating your own bot and are here for just a part of code or just a command, please just leave a review or star the repository as that just gives me more confidence that the code I wrote is useful.
# Thank You!
